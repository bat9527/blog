It started with a dream and a laptop. It ended with burnout and a hard lesson in marketing.

### Day 1: The Idea
I thought I had the next billion-dollar idea. A to-do list app... but for cats.

### Day 15: The Build
I spent 2 weeks perfecting the CSS animations. I hadn't spoken to a single user yet.

### Day 30: The Launch
I launched on Product Hunt.
**Result:** 3 upvotes (one was my mom).

### The Lesson
Build distribution *before* you build the product.
