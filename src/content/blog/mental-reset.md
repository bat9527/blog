We are all overstimulated. Between Slack notifications, emails, and social media, our brains rarely get a moment of true silence.

This simple 5-minute routine is based on the **physiological sigh** and box breathing techniques used by Navy SEALs to regulate their nervous systems.

## The Routine

1.  **Inhale** deeply through your nose for 4 seconds.
2.  **Hold** your breath for 4 seconds.
3.  **Exhale** slowly through your mouth for 4 seconds.
4.  **Hold** empty for 4 seconds.

Repeat this cycle 4 times. You will feel your heart rate lower almost immediately.
