The hype cycle is a well-documented phenomenon in the technology sector. We saw it with the Dot-com bubble, we saw it with Crypto, and now we are seeing it with Generative AI.

*   Data scarcity is becoming a real bottleneck.

However, just like the internet boom, once the bubble bursts, the *real* utility will remain and transform society.
